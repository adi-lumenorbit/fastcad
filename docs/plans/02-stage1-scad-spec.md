# 02 — Stage 1: `.scad`-as-spec

GitHub issue: https://github.com/adi-lumenorbit/fastcad/issues/2

## Problem

Today the agent calls `add_primitive` / `boolean` and the backend
maintains an op log that must round-trip into `.scad` for export.
Two formats. Edits like "make it 25 mm long" regenerate from scratch.
Anchors are bbox heuristics. The agent has to call `list_scene` every
turn to recover state.

The fix isn't more primitives — it's collapsing the spec and the
export into one format the agent already speaks fluently: OpenSCAD.

## Context — three tries, what changed

**Try 1 (rejected): more primitives.** Add `extrude_polygon`,
`revolve_polygon`, `polyhedron`, `transform`. Optimised the symptom
(a single complex prompt) not the system. Op log + bbox anchors
stay; same ceiling.

**Try 2 (rejected as too verbose): JSON spec + patches.**
Replace the op log with a JSON `Spec` — params + named features +
`@ref`s — that the agent edits via `apply_patch`. The model becomes
declarative, edits become first-class, identity becomes semantic.
The core insight is right but the *encoding* is wrong: JSON is a
wire format, not a thinking format. A handful of features in any
non-trivial design balloon to dozens of lines of `{"name", "kind",
"args", "@ref"}` ceremony for what should be a few lines of CAD
code.

**Try 3 (this plan): the spec is `.scad` source.** Same insight as
try 2 — declarative model, agent rewrites it, system re-derives —
but the encoding *is the export format*. There is exactly one
representation of the model: a `.scad` source string. It is what the
agent reads, what the agent writes, what the export returns, and
what reads back when the user opens the file in real OpenSCAD. The
only translation in the system is `text → AST → manifold`, which is
just evaluation.

The current `CLAUDE.md` invariant says ".scad is export-only — never
used as input." That exists because there is no parser. Building one
inverts the invariant; the new invariant becomes "spec source IS the
.scad export." Single source of truth.

## What this looks like for the agent and the user

The system prompt (cached) embeds the current `.scad` source verbatim
each turn. The user prompts; the agent responds with `set_source(<new
.scad>)`. The backend parses, AST-diffs against the previous source,
re-evaluates only modules whose definitions or transitive dependencies
changed, sends a `scene_delta` for affected nodes.

A typical spec looks like a hand-written `.scad` document: a small
parameter block at the top, a few named modules describing parts of
the design, and one top-level call assembling them. Per the project's
"no hardcoded designs" rule (see `CLAUDE.md`), this plan deliberately
does **not** bake in a worked example for any specific standardized
part — the agent recalls those from its training each time.

For an edit like "make it bigger" the agent rewrites a single param
in the spec and resends. The AST diff sees only the changed literal;
modules that don't depend on that param cache-hit and aren't
re-evaluated.

For an addition like "put a feature on top of X" the agent extends
the source with a new module and updates the assembling top-level
call. No JSON, no patches — just OpenSCAD.

## Metadata strategy — "stay a `.scad`"

The temptation is to bolt sidecar metadata onto the spec. Resist it.
Two principles:

1. **Anything the system needs is derived from `.scad` structure**:
   - **Param table**: top-level scalar assignments preceding the
     first `module` definition.
   - **Module call graph**: built by the parser.
   - **Named faces per module**: derived from body kind
     (`linear_extrude` → `+Z`/`-Z`/`lateral`).
   - **Per-id node names**: the module call name at the top level.
   - **The "main scene"**: convention — last top-level statement.
2. **The two minimal annotations we *do* embrace are pre-existing
   OpenSCAD conventions**:
   - One-line `//` docstring above each `module` (agent emits, system
     ignores; pure readability).
   - OpenSCAD Customizer comment syntax for parameters (`// [min:max]`
     etc.) — round-trips through real OpenSCAD untouched.

What we **do not** add: `/* @fastcad-meta { … } */` JSON frontmatter,
`// @main` / `// @anchor` tags, dependency-graph comments, or
author/timestamp metadata in the source. The export file is byte-
equivalent to the spec source.

## Subset of OpenSCAD supported in v1

**Top-level**: variable assignment, module definition, module call,
`$fn`, line / block comments.

**Expressions**: numeric literals, vectors, arithmetic
(`+ - * / %` + unary), comparisons, boolean, conditionals (`?:`),
function calls (`sin cos tan asin acos atan atan2 sqrt pow abs min
max floor ceil round len concat`, `PI`), variable references, vector
indexing.

**Statements**: `for (var = [start:end])`, range with step,
list-form `for (var = [list])`, `if/else`, `let`.

**Built-ins delegated to `kernel.py`**:
- 3D: `cube`, `sphere`, `cylinder`, `polyhedron`
- 2D: `circle`, `square`, `polygon`
- Extrude: `linear_extrude(height=, twist=, scale=)`,
  `rotate_extrude(angle=)`
- Transform: `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`, `mirror`
- CSG: `union`, `difference`, `intersection`

**Out of v1** (parser rejects with hint): `function` defs,
`include`/`use`, `import`, `hull`/`minkowski`/`offset`/`projection`,
`text`/`surface`/`color`, `assert`/`echo`, `each`, recursion in
modules.

## Fix

### What stays
`model/kernel.py` (extended), wire format / WS message types,
`web/*`, `server/feedback.py`, `server/app.py`. Single-source-of-
manifold3d invariant preserved.

### What goes
`model/ops.py`, `model/scene.py`, `model/scad.py` deleted; their
`AddPrimitive`/`Boolean`/`SceneGraph`/render-emitter responsibilities
dissolve into the parser + evaluator + diff trio.

### What's new

- **`model/scad_parser.py`** — `lark` grammar (~150 lines) + AST node
  dataclasses (~200 LOC) + transformer. Returns a frozen AST.
- **`model/scad_eval.py`** — walks AST, resolves variables, dispatches
  to kernel, composes for transforms / CSG. Returns
  `dict[node_id → ModuleEval]` where `ModuleEval` carries
  `{manifold, bbox, face_dict, content_hash}`.
- **`model/scad_faces.py`** — per-feature-kind named faces (`+Z`/`-Z`/
  `lateral` for extrude, `±X/±Y/±Z` for cube/sphere, etc.). Semantic
  only — no manifold3d face_id wiring in v1.
- **`model/spec_diff.py`** — parse both sources, walk top-level
  invocation tree, compare per-id content hashes; emit
  added/updated/removed.

### What's changed

```python
# session.py
@dataclass
class SessionState:
    current_source: str
    undo_stack: list[str]
    redo_stack: list[str]
    cache: dict[str, ModuleEval]

    def set_source(self, text: str) -> ChangeSet: ...
    def undo(self) -> ChangeSet: ...
    def redo(self) -> ChangeSet: ...
    def reset(self) -> None: ...
```

`server/ws.py`: `_node_payload(ctx, node_id)` pulls
`session.cache[node_id].manifold` instead of `scene.nodes[node_id].manifold`.
Wire format unchanged.

`agent/tools.py` exports `read_source`, `set_source`, `validate`,
`select_face`, `ask_user`. `add_primitive` / `boolean` / `list_scene`
removed.

`agent/system_prompt.py` rewritten: documents the subset, lists the
language conventions and the output style guide, embeds the current
source verbatim every turn. Per the `CLAUDE.md` "no hardcoded
designs" rule, the prompt does **not** contain a worked example for
any specific part. Editing rule: "rewrite the whole `.scad` with your
change applied; the system handles incremental rendering."

`agent/client.py`: real mode renders source into the system prompt
before each `messages.create`; fake mode's regex matchers emit
`set_source(text)` instead of `add_primitive` chains.

### Naming convention for transport

- Top-level module call → node id == module name (e.g. a top-level
  call to `module foo() {…}` becomes node id `"foo"`).
- Anonymous top-level expression → synthetic id `_top_<n>`.
- Agent best practice (per system prompt): always wrap visible
  geometry in a named module and call it at the bottom.

### How incremental rebuild works

1. Agent calls `set_source(new_text)`.
2. `scad_parser.parse(new_text)` → new AST.
3. `spec_diff.diff(old_ast, new_ast)`:
   - Per top-level invocation, compute content hash recursively over
     (kind + args + transitive dep hashes).
   - Hash same as cached → cache-hit.
   - Hash differs → invalidate, mark `updated`.
   - New id → `added`. Vanished id → `removed`.
4. For invalidated/new ids: re-evaluate via `scad_eval.evaluate`,
   update cache.
5. ChangeSet → `ws.py`, builds `_node_payload(ctx, nid)` from cache,
   emits `scene_delta`.

For a typical "edit one parameter" change: ~10 ms total. Modules
that don't reference the edited parameter cache-hit and aren't
re-evaluated.

## Existing functions to reuse

- `kernel.cube` / `sphere` / `cylinder` / `translate` / `union` /
  `difference` — eval dispatches.
- `kernel.BBox.from_manifold`, `kernel.to_mesh_dict` — payload.
- `server/ws.py` framing helpers (`_send`, `_summary`, `_emit_turn`)
  — unchanged shape.
- Fake-mode helpers `_extract_mm`, `_NUM`, `_call` — kept; matchers
  rewrite.

## Tests

### Unit (`.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit -q`)

- `test_scad_parser.py` — round-trip on a range of fixtures
  exercising the supported subset (a complex threaded-extrude with
  twist + nested for/rotate/translate/polygon/difference, a
  rotate_extrude profile, a polyhedron tetra, nested booleans,
  `for/if/let`). Error cases: missing semicolons, unsupported
  keyword, unknown function.
- `test_scad_eval.py` — fixture sources → expected manifold volumes
  within tolerance; named faces correct; cycle detection rejects
  recursive modules.
- `test_kernel_new.py` — `extrude_polygon` (unit square, 1 mm³),
  `revolve_polygon` (annulus, known volume), `polyhedron_from_mesh`
  (tetra), `apply_transform(translate)` shifts bbox.
- `test_spec_diff.py` — change literal → only dependents invalidate;
  rename → remove + add; cascade through callers; hash
  determinism.
- `test_session.py` — `set_source` happy path; parse error returns
  error and does NOT mutate; undo/redo restore prior source + cache;
  reset clears.
- `test_agent_tools_v2.py` — `set_source` end-to-end (fake);
  `validate` doesn't mutate; `select_face` returns correct
  point/normal for `linear_extrude` `+Z`.

### E2E (`bash scripts/e2e.sh`)

Existing 5 tests rewritten under new pipeline. Plus:

- `test_spec_edit.py` — "make a 20mm cube" → mesh appears → "make it
  30mm" → same per-id mesh updated, bbox 30³.
- `test_export_round_trip.py` — Export returns
  `session.current_source` byte-for-byte.

### Manual real-Claude verification

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… bash scripts/dev.sh   # http://localhost:8765/
```

Pick any standardized part the user might ask for ("a threaded
fastener of your choice", "a hex bracket", "a stepper-motor
mount") and walk through:

1. **Initial design** — agent calls `set_source` once; the result
   is a valid `.scad` export that opens in real OpenSCAD.
2. **Resize a parameter** ("make it longer") — single `set_source`;
   the resulting `scene_delta` only updates the modules that
   actually depend on the edited parameter. Modules that don't
   reference it cache-hit.
3. **Add a feature on top of an existing part** — agent uses
   `select_face("<existing_module>", "+Z")` and emits a new module
   plus an updated assembling top-level call; the new feature
   lands on the chosen face.
4. **Replace one module's geometry** ("make it hexagonal instead of
   round") — agent rewrites only that module's body; only that
   module and any modules unioning it invalidate; siblings
   cache-hit.

Test (4) is the most important — it's the edit no flat-CSG model
handles cleanly.

## Cost / descope

Estimate ~14–18 hours focused work. Descope choices:

- **A. Constrained-syntax minimum.** Drop `for / if / let / ?:` and
  function-calls in v1. ~10–12 hrs. Not recommended — any non-
  trivial parametric design (helical threads, gear teeth, repeated
  patterns) needs computed values that require these constructs.
- **B. Stage 1a — parser + evaluator only, no caching.** Always
  full-re-evaluate on `set_source`. ~10–12 hrs. Spec / export / agent
  UX still right. Reasonable if shipping fast matters.
- **C. Full Stage 1 as written.** ~14–18 hrs. Recommended.

User-approved scope: **C (full)**.
